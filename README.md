It has dependency on:
1. `npm i prop-types --save`
2. `npm i react --save`
3. `npm i @blueprintjs/core --save`

You can easily modify and remove 3rd, but while i was using this lib while building https://www.geekystats.com/ it's there.

I needed auto complete field and blueprint doesn't have it yet. I've created my own, you can use it for whatever needed.
